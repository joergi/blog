## Plastic Bomb - Was ist das Fediverse? #131 2/2025"
The Plastic bomb is a German punk magazine, which is published every three months, with a circulation of 8000 copies.    
Those who know me for a long time, know I'm coming not only from a nerd world - but also from the music world. Punk especially!     
And, if you followed me along Social Media, you know I'm a big fan of the Fediverse and I'm trying to promote it, as much as possible.     
As the Punk music is always into DIY (do it yourself) and anti-corporate, I thought it would be a good idea to write an article about the Fediverse for the Plastic Bomb magazine.

When the next Plastic Bomb issue will be out, I will add the complete (and longer) article here as a blog post, and link the original (shorter) one, if it's available online.
