Because I was living in 2011 for 3 month in my favourite city Barcelona, I am asked so many times for Barcelona Tips...    
So here we go:

<!-- more -->

**Concerts**
- Always have a look at [THIS FORUM](https://barcelonahardcore.mforos.com/457647-conciertos/), it's in catalan, but you can get the informations out of the postings and use your favorite translate website, it will help you too! Best online information for squat shows (but let me tell you: they start really really late... )
- [Estraperlo Club del Ritme](https://estraperlo.club/), Club in Badalona (so it's little bit outside of BCN) where you can watch many cool Bands (I saw Dickies, Dwarves and many more there), Isidre Nonell 9, Badalona, (Metro: L2 Badalona Pompeu Fabra, and walking, there is also some Bus stops, have a look online for more information)
P.S. Badalona has a perfect beach - so go there during the day, swim drink some beer and get than to the concert 
- [Sala Razzmatazz](https://www.salarazzmatazz.com), Big concert location, Pamplona 88, 1er piso, 08018, Barcelona, (Metro: L1 Marina or L4 Bogatell)


**Bars**
- [Mariatchi Bar](https://www.instagram.com/bar_mariatchi/) - Bar of Manu Chao 
This bar is owned by the musician [Manu Chao](https://www.manuchao.net/), it's always packed but has a nice (hippie) atmosphere.
You can buy bottle of self-made vino, olives and honey. 
And: a nice CD sampler with all the Manu Chao related bands. Music is a mixture of "world-music" and sometimes punk.
On youtube you can find also [videos where Manu Chao played in his bar](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=manu+chao+bar+mariatchi), but i never saw this.
C/Codols 14 - 08002 - Barcelona, (Metro: L4 Jaume I, L4 Barceloneta, L3 Liceu)
- [The Bollocks](https://www.bollocksbar.com/)
Nice Punk/Metal Bar
Ample 46, Barrio Gotico, Barcelona
(Metro: L4 Barceloneta)


** Vegan
Vegan is not really common in Barcelona, but of course [Happy Cow knows lists many vegan stuff](https://www.happycow.net/europe/spain/barcelona/) but I will only list places, where I have been.
- [La Cerveseria](https://www.lacerveseria.com/)
A normal restaurant in the lovely Gracia area, where they serve tapas but also a nice vegan soy `bocadillo` (sandwich) and beer
Plaça Revolució de Setembre 3,08012 Barcelona,
(Metro: L3 Fontana or L4 Joanic  + walking)

** Tapas

You can find tapas around every corner. If you see many trash on the floor of the tapas bar, go in! It's a sign, that it's a perfect visited tapas bar!
- [Cervecería Catalana](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187497-d782944-Reviews-Cerveceria_Catalana-Barcelona_Catalonia.html)
High quality Tapas, little bit expensive, more for dinner than for lunch
Carrer de Mallorca, 236 08008 Barcelona
Metro: L3 + L5 Diagonal)

Update Feb 2025
This lists were a lot bigger when I first posted it, but most of the restaurants/clubs are closed nowadays :-(
