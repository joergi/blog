Berlin has so many cool bars and restaurants to offer...
I'm many times asked: what should we do? And no, I don't want to write always the same stuff again, so I was thinking of making this list!

Vegan food
First of all: [www.berlin-vegan.de](http://www.berlin-vegan.de) has nearly all vegan stuff covered..
Download the [Android app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.berlin_vegan.bvapp) or the [iPhone app](https://itunes.apple.com/de/app/berlin-vegan-guide/id435371382) and you are fine.
